Simple weather app that fetches data from the OpenWeather Api. Find details about their Api here -> https://openweathermap.org/

Simply select the city and units of measurement that you would like the information to be displayed in and the app will tell you what the current weather is as well as whether or not to bring an umbrella for the day.

Additionally, you can select how long you will be out of the house for, and you will be told if that changes if you should bring an umbrella or not. For example, it might not rain in the next 3 hours, but if it does in the next 9 hours and that's when you'll be coming home from work or day-trip, the app will suggest you bring an umbrella.
